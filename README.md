# Data Exploring for the Mental Health Dataset
Dataset: [Mental Health](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health)
Had fun, and learned a lot of techniques this repository is for the cleaned dataset and then used that dataset with Tableau to Visualize this Dataset
The Visualization: [Bangladesh Mental Health Stat](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/srayoshi.mirza/viz/BangladeshMentalHealthStat/Dashboard1)

This Project was done while following [Data Analyst Portfolio Project | SQL Data Exploration | Project 1/4](https://youtu.be/qfyynHBFOsM?si=tbLdwBZCioccyAnx)
